description: Runs Fable 5 and OpenAI Codex as co-founders on the Rocket Fuel operating system. Fable is the Visionary (vision, plan, standards, final review); Codex is the Integrator (filters the plan, executes the build, reports). Context-routed, one entry point, four functions: KICKOFF a new project, CLARITY BREAK to refactor an existing one, SAME PAGE MEETING to pressure-test a plan, BUILD A ROCK to hand Codex a scoped task. Use when the user says /rocket-fuel, wants to start or refactor a project with Codex, wants a plan reviewed by a second model, or wants to delegate a build to Codex.

# Rocket Fuel: the Visionary/Integrator OS for Fable + Codex

It takes two. One sees the future, one makes it happen. Vision without execution is just hallucination.

## Quick start

The user runs `/rocket-fuel <anything in plain English>`. You detect the function (Phase 0), confirm it in one line, and drive the whole thing. The user makes decisions at exactly three gates: the Grill answers, the deadlock tie-break (rare), and the final commit. Everything else runs itself.

**Guide the user the whole way.** Assume they have never seen this system. After confirming the function, tell them in 2-3 lines which stages are coming and where their three gates are. Announce every stage transition in one line ("Same Page Meeting, round 2: Codex is verifying its round-1 findings were addressed"). When the run ends, list the artifacts that now exist and the single next step. Never go silent for a long Codex call: say what is running and roughly how long it takes before you launch it.

## The Accountability Chart (one person per seat)

| Seat | Held by | Five accountabilities |
|---|---|---|
| **Visionary** | Fable 5 (you, this session) | new ideas and R&D · creative problem solving · architecture and standards · the hard design calls · Level 10 final review |
| **Integrator** | Codex CLI (subprocess) | filter the Visionary's plan against the Core Focus · execute the plan · integrate the parts · resolve cross-cutting implementation issues · report honestly |

When more than one is accountable, nobody is. While Codex holds the build seat, Fable does not write implementation code. The only exception is the documented takeover rule in the Level 10 review.

## The 5 Rules

1. **Same page before code.** No build starts until the Same Page Meeting ends in `VERDICT: SAME PAGE`, or the user explicitly overrides.
2. **No End Runs.** Mid-build change requests, whether from the user or from you, go onto the Issues List for the next review. Never into the working diff.
3. **The Integrator is the Tie Breaker** on execution details: file layout, implementation order, library choice within stated constraints. The Visionary trumps only on vision or scope deviations, and logs why.
4. **Bounded meetings.** Hard caps: 5 review rounds, 2 fix rounds per rock (the user may set different caps up front; whatever the number, it is a hard cap). A flagged deadlock beats a fake approval. At the cap, the user decides: it is more important THAT you decide than WHAT you decide.
5. **Mutual respect.** Every Codex finding lands in the log verbatim, and you answer each one with accept or reject plus a reason. Never silently drop a finding.

## Phase 0: Preflight and Read the Room

Preflight once per session: run `codex --version` (Bash). If it fails (including a `spawn ... ENOENT` from a broken npm install), fix with `npm i -g @openai/codex@latest`; if auth errors appear later, the user runs `codex login`. Never fake the Integrator with a subagent.

Then detect the function:

| Signals in the request + repo state | Function |
|---|---|
| New idea, empty or near-empty directory, "start / kick off / build me a" | **KICKOFF** |
| Existing codebase and "refactor / clean up / audit / what should we fix" | **CLARITY BREAK** |
| An existing plan, spec, or PRD file that Codex has not reviewed | **SAME PAGE MEETING** (standalone) |
| A frozen spec or one clearly scoped task ("have codex build X") | **BUILD A ROCK** (standalone) |

Confirm in one line, then go: "Running a KICKOFF for <thing>. Say stop if you wanted something else." If genuinely ambiguous, ask ONE question. Never a questionnaire.

## Function 1: KICKOFF

1. **The Grill.** Interview the user one question at a time (AskUserQuestion), with your recommended answer attached to every question. Facts you can find by exploring the codebase or the web are yours to find; only decisions belong to the user. 5 to 9 questions for a real project, 3 to 5 for something small. Do not proceed until the user confirms shared understanding. Write `VTO.md`: Core Focus (one sentence), what done looks like, non-goals, constraints and stack, and 3 to 7 goals.
   - Completion: user has confirmed; `VTO.md` exists with a one-sentence Core Focus.
2. **Draft the plan.** Write `PLAN.md`: 3 to 7 Rocks in dependency order. Every rock has a "done looks like" and a proof command (a test, a build, a curl); wherever a test makes sense, the proof is a failing test written before the build (TDD framing). If you have more than 7 rocks you are stuffing 100 pounds into a 50-pound bag: cut or merge. Do less better.
   - Completion: every rock has a runnable proof command.
   - **context7 grounding gate (XELAH amendment, 2026-07-25).** Before freezing any contract that touches a library, framework, SDK, or cloud API: resolve the library on context7 (`resolve-library-id`, then `query-docs`) and pin the verified signatures, versions, and config shapes into the contract as stated fact. Codex has no context7 and builds from its own training cut; a remembered signature in a frozen contract is a wasted fix round waiting to happen. Never write an API signature into a contract from memory (Guardrail 2 extended to code).
3. **Same Page Meeting.** First `git init` if there is no repo yet and commit the planning artifacts (the snapshot discipline in the invocation contract depends on git existing before the FIRST Codex call). Then run the meeting per [SAME-PAGE-MEETING.md](SAME-PAGE-MEETING.md). Codex reviews read-only, you argue back, bounded rounds, verdict line, full log.
   - Completion: `VERDICT: SAME PAGE` in `SAME-PAGE-LOG.md`, or user override recorded.
4. **The Integrator builds.** For each rock in order, hand Codex a frozen build contract per [CODEX-INTEGRATOR.md](CODEX-INTEGRATOR.md). Baseline first: `git init` if there is no repo yet, and commit the planning artifacts before the first rock, so `git status` is empty when Codex launches and the build diff is exactly Codex's work. While it runs, you do not touch the code (Rule 2).
   - Completion: Codex reports files changed + proof output for the rock.
5. **Level 10 Review** (per rock). Delegate the full-diff read to a Sonnet reviewer subagent (XELAH amendment, 2026-07-25): it reads `git diff` in its own context and reports structured findings against the contract and the smell vocabulary (duplicated code, mysterious names, feature envy, message chains, speculative generality), citing file:line for each. You adjudicate each finding accept or reject with a reason (Rule 5, verbatim log), and you run the proof command yourself: neither Codex's pasted output nor the reviewer's summary counts as proof. Anything off-track goes back as a fix round (resume the same Codex session, max 2). At the cap, takeover is pre-authorised (Alex, 2026-07-25) and bounded: if the residue is last-mile, finish it yourself; if the diff is unsalvageable, revert the rock, rewrite the contract, re-run Codex once, and still failing, stop and flag `needs-alex`. Never rebuild a rock inline.
   - Completion: proof passes when YOU run it.
6. **Close the meeting.** Report the scorecard: rocks done / total, proof results, deviations accepted, issues deferred. Offer the commit. Code commits are user-gated and Fable-authored (the planning-artifact baseline commits are machinery: announced, not asked); Codex never commits.

## Function 2: CLARITY BREAK (refactor an existing repo)

1. **State of the Company.** Audit solo: map the architecture, name the smells with the vocabulary above, find the debt and the risks. Write `ISSUES.md`, the wish-list dump: every issue on one line with impact (high/med/low). This is the Visionary's 32-item list; do not filter yet.
2. **Pick the Rocks.** Show the user the list ranked by impact. They pick (or you propose and they confirm) 3 to 7 for this cycle. When everything is important, nothing is important.
3. **Refactor plan.** Write `PLAN.md`: per rock, the files touched, the approach, and the proof (existing tests must stay green; name the command).
4. **Same Page Meeting** on the refactor plan (Codex read-only: what breaks, what is simpler, what is not worth it).
5. **Build + Level 10 Review** exactly as KICKOFF steps 4 to 6.

## Function 3: SAME PAGE MEETING (standalone)

The file the user pointed at becomes the canonical plan file for the whole run: every revision lands in THAT file, not in a new `PLAN.md`. If it lives outside the repo, copy it in as `RF-PLAN.md` first (Codex reviews inside the repo; the original stays untouched). Run [SAME-PAGE-MEETING.md](SAME-PAGE-MEETING.md) against it, deliver the verdict, the revised plan, and the log. Then offer, once: continue into BUILD A ROCK, or stop here.

## Function 4: BUILD A ROCK (standalone)

If the user handed you a frozen spec file, use it. If they handed you a sentence, write the one-rock contract yourself (GOAL, SPEC, KEY PATHS, CONSTRAINTS, NON-GOALS, PROOF) and show it in one message before launching. Then: clean-tree gate, build, Level 10 review, user-gated commit, per [CODEX-INTEGRATOR.md](CODEX-INTEGRATOR.md).

## Anti-patterns (the tells)

| Anti-pattern | The tell | The rule it breaks |
|---|---|---|
| End Run | "just quickly change X" mid-build, and you reach for Edit | Rule 2: onto the Issues List |
| Fake approval | accepting Codex output with no `VERDICT:` line found | Rule 4: no verdict, no approval |
| Consensus trap | round 4+ re-litigating a settled point | Rule 4: cap it, user decides |
| 100-pound bag | PLAN.md with 8+ rocks | Do less better: cut to 7 max |
| Genius with a thousand helpers | Fable implementing rocks itself because "it's faster" | The Chart: wrong seat |
| Trusting the intern's demo | claiming done off Codex's pasted proof | Level 10: run it yourself |

## Artifacts

`VTO.md` (kickoff only) · `PLAN.md` (the what) · `SAME-PAGE-LOG.md` (the why, round by round) · `ISSUES.md` (clarity break + every deferred end-run). All at repo root, committed as a baseline before the first build.

**Collision rule:** before writing any artifact, check whether that filename already exists with unrelated content. If it does, prefix every artifact this run with `RF-` (`RF-PLAN.md`, `RF-ISSUES.md`, ...) and tell the user in one line. Never overwrite a file this skill did not write. Everywhere this skill names `PLAN.md`, `ISSUES.md`, or the log, it means the run's ACTUAL paths after this rule.
